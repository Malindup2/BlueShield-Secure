# BlueShield – Life Below Water

SE3040: Application Frameworks Team Project

## Project Overview

BlueShield is a full stack web application designed to help fishermen and authorities report, track, and manage illegal fishing activities and marine hazards. The platform supports secure reporting, case management, enforcement, and marine safety, with real-time data and external API integrations. The system is inspired by the need for sustainable marine resource management and protection of local fishing communities.

## Key Features

- Incident reporting and categorization (illegal fishing, hazards)
- Case management and review workflows
- Enforcement actions and AI-powered risk scoring
- Marine hazard and restricted zone management
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Analytics and dashboards for users and admin
- Integration with external APIs (Mapbox, Vessel Data, Open-Meteo, Gemini)
- Responsive React frontend with state management

## Architecture Overview

**Tech Stack:**

- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Frontend: React.js (functional components, Hooks)
- Database: MongoDB
- State Management: Context API (or Redux)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap
- Deployment: Backend → Render/Railway, Frontend → Vercel/Netlify
- Testing: Jest, Supertest, Artillery

### Testing Instructions
For comprehensive testing instructions, including Unit, Integration, and Performance testing setup and execution, please refer to the **[Testing Instruction Report](./docs/Testing_Instruction_Report.md)**.

## Best Practices
- Use a single `.gitignore` at the root; do NOT commit `.env` or `.env.local`
- Commit `.env.template` for onboarding
- Use meaningful commit messages and regular pushes
- Follow clean architecture: controllers, services, models, routes, utils
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
